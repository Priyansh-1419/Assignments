1. Create a form that accepts a name, password and pass it on to the servlet
a. The receiving servlet should check the name and password against a hard coded 
list of name-password pairs stored in a HashMap. 
b. HashMap should be initialized with some dummy usernames and passwords in 
the constructor/init method of the servlet.
c. Servlet should return either 'Name/Password Match' or 'Name/Password Does 
Not Match' back to client.
2. In the above Question, use forward and redirect. If the username and password is 
correct, set a request attribute named “message” and the value for the same is 
“'Name/Password Match”. Forward the request using RequestDispatcher forward() 
method to another servlet and print all three values there – Username and password 
entered by user and the ‘message’ attribute. 
If the password is incorrect, redirect the request to an error page using 
ServletResponse.sendRedirect()
3. In the above question, replace sendRedirect() method with sendError() method. 
4. Write a servlet that redirects requests form one host to another host, giving an 
explanation to the client before the redirection. As we generally see during payment 
and request will be redirected to bank website.
5. Create a servlet that displays the servlet config and servlet context parameters. For this 
purpose, you can create more than one servlet.
6. Map error-code ‘404’ with an underconstruction.html page. Whenever 404 error occurs, 
instead of showing the default error page, it shows ‘underconstruction.html’ page.
7. Map java.lang.Exception with an ErrorServlet. 
8. Create a Customer Registration Form with the below mentioned fields:
Name Data Type Screen Object
Customer Name String Text field
Date of Birth LocalDate Date
Email Address String Text field
Contact Number String Text field
Monthly Salary Double Text field
Gender Char Radio Button
Hobbies String array Check box
Location String Drop-down
Generate customer id and password and return the same to the customer post 
successful registration.
