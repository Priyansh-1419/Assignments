Create a Restful WebService to send "Hello World" back to the user. Use Postman API to test your Service.

As an AI language model, I cannot create a RESTful Web Service as I do not have the capability to execute code. However, I can provide you with an example of how to create a simple RESTful Web Service in Java using Spring Boot framework that returns "Hello World" as a response.

Here's an example code snippet that you can use as a starting point:

java

Copy code

import org.springframework.boot.SpringApplication;

import org.springframework.boot.autoconfigure.SpringBootApplication;

import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.GetMapping;

import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.RestController;

@SpringBootApplication

@RestController

public class HelloWorldService {

    public static void main(String[] args) {

        SpringApplication.run(HelloWorldService.class, args);

    }

    @GetMapping("/hello")

    public String helloWorld() {

        return "Hello World";

    }

}

This code defines a simple RESTful Web Service that listens to requests on the "/hello" endpoint and returns a "Hello World" response. To test the service, you can use a tool like Postman API:

Open Postman and create a new request.

Set the request method to GET and enter the URL of your service (e.g., http://localhost:8080/hello).

Click on the Send button.

The response should display "Hello World".

Note that you will need to have Spring Boot and any necessary dependencies installed to run this example code. Also, make sure to update the URL and port to match your specific setup.

In the same question add a Query String as mentioned below: <a href="webservice?name=<somename>">Web Service Demo</a>

Sure, I can help you with that!

Here's an updated code snippet that includes a Query String parameter in the URL:

java

Copy code

import org.springframework.boot.SpringApplication;

import org.springframework.boot.autoconfigure.SpringBootApplication;

import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.GetMapping;

import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.RequestParam;

import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.RestController;

@SpringBootApplication

@RestController

public class HelloWorldService {

    public static void main(String[] args) {

        SpringApplication.run(HelloWorldService.class, args);

    }

    @GetMapping("/webservice")

    public String helloWorld(@RequestParam(value = "name", defaultValue = "World") String name) {

        return "Hello " + name;

    }

}

In this updated code, we added a new GetMapping annotation with the endpoint "/webservice". We also added a new parameter to the helloWorld method called name, which is annotated with RequestParam to indicate that it is a Query String parameter. The value attribute specifies the name of the parameter, and defaultValue sets the default value to "World" if no value is provided.

To test the service with the Query String parameter, you can use Postman API:

Open Postman and create a new request.

Set the request method to GET and enter the URL of your service with the Query String parameter (e.g., http://localhost:8080/webservice?name=John).

Click on the Send button.

The response should display "Hello John" or the name you provided in the Query String.

Note that you can change the value of the defaultValue attribute to set a different default value for the name parameter.

Retrieve this parameter with the help of @QueryParam annotation and send a message "Hello" +username back to client application. Use Postman API to test your service

â†’In both the above questions, Rest Service produces a String response.

Sure, I can help you with that as well!

Here's an updated code snippet that includes a Query String parameter retrieved with the @QueryParam annotation:

java

Copy code

import javax.ws.rs.GET;

import javax.ws.rs.Path;

import javax.ws.rs.QueryParam;

import javax.ws.rs.core.Response;

@Path("/webservice")

public class HelloWorldService {

    @GET

    public Response helloWorld(@QueryParam("name") String name) {

        String message = "Hello " + name;

        return Response.status(200).entity(message).build();

    }

}

In this updated code, we added a new @GET annotation to indicate that the endpoint responds to GET requests. We also added a new parameter to the helloWorld method called name, which is annotated with @QueryParam to indicate that it is a Query String parameter.

To test the service with the Query String parameter, you can use Postman API:

Open Postman and create a new request.

Set the request method to GET and enter the URL of your service with the Query String parameter (e.g., http://localhost:8080/webservice?name=John).

Click on the Send button.

The response should display "Hello John" or the name you provided in the Query String.

Note that in this updated code, we are returning a Response object instead of a String. The Response object is built using the Response class from the javax.ws.rs.core package. We are setting the HTTP status code to 200 (OK) and setting the message as the entity of the response.

Also note that we are using the JAX-RS (Java API for RESTful Web Services) annotations and classes instead of Spring Boot. JAX-RS is another popular framework for building RESTful Web Services in Java.

Change the above question to use @PathParam annotation. <a href="webservice/name"> WebService Demo</a>

Sure, I can help you with that!

Here's an updated code snippet that includes a Path Parameter retrieved with the @PathParam annotation:

java

Copy code

import javax.ws.rs.GET;

import javax.ws.rs.Path;

import javax.ws.rs.PathParam;

import javax.ws.rs.core.Response;

@Path("/webservice/{name}")

public class HelloWorldService {

    @GET

    public Response helloWorld(@PathParam("name") String name) {

        String message = "Hello " + name;

        return Response.status(200).entity(message).build();

    }

}

In this updated code, we added a new @Path annotation to indicate the endpoint "/webservice/{name}", where {name} is a Path Parameter. We also added a new parameter to the helloWorld method called name, which is annotated with @PathParam to indicate that it is a Path Parameter.

To test the service with the Path Parameter, you can use Postman API:

Open Postman and create a new request.

Set the request method to GET and enter the URL of your service with the Path Parameter (e.g., http://localhost:8080/webservice/John).

Click on the Send button.

The response should display "Hello John" or the name you provided in the Path Parameter.

Note that we are using the @PathParam annotation to retrieve the value of the Path Parameter. The value of the Path Parameter is passed as an argument to the helloWorld method.

Also note that we are using the JAX-RS (Java API for RESTful Web Services) annotations and classes instead of Spring Boot. JAX-RS is another popular framework for building RESTful Web Services in Java.

Create a RESTful web service to fetch details of all the loans by a particular customer by providing the customerld. The details should be of all loans - active and closed.

Write complete code

Sure, here's an example code for a RESTful web service to fetch details of all the loans by a particular customer by providing the customerId. The details returned by the service include all loans - active and closed.

This code assumes that you are using the Spring Boot framework and have set up a MySQL database with a table called "loans" that contains the loan details. The table should have columns such as id, customerId, amount, interestRate, status, startDate, and endDate.

Here's the code:

java

Copy code

import java.util.List;

import javax.ws.rs.GET;

import javax.ws.rs.Path;

import javax.ws.rs.PathParam;

import javax.ws.rs.core.MediaType;

import javax.ws.rs.core.Response;

import org.springframework.beans.factory.annotation.Autowired;

import org.springframework.stereotype.Component;

import com.example.demo.entity.Loan;

import com.example.demo.service.LoanService;

@Component

@Path("/loan")

public class LoanController {

    @Autowired

    private LoanService loanService;

    @GET

    @Path("/{customerId}")

    @Produces(MediaType.APPLICATION_JSON)

    public Response getLoansByCustomerId(@PathParam("customerId") int customerId) {

        List<Loan> loans = loanService.getLoansByCustomerId(customerId);

        return Response.ok().entity(loans).build();

    }

}

In this code, we have created a new RESTful web service called "LoanController" that handles requests related to loans. The endpoint for this service is /loan/{customerId}.

The @Autowired annotation is used to inject a LoanService object into the LoanController.

The @GET annotation is used to indicate that this endpoint will respond to HTTP GET requests.

The @Path annotation is used to define the path of the endpoint, which includes the Path Parameter {customerId}.

The @Produces annotation is used to specify the type of data returned by the endpoint. In this case, we are returning data in JSON format.

The getLoansByCustomerId method retrieves a list of loans from the LoanService object by calling the getLoansByCustomerId method with the customerId provided in the Path Parameter. The list of loans is then returned as a response.

Here's the code for the LoanService:

java

Copy code

import java.util.List;

import org.springframework.beans.factory.annotation.Autowired;

import org.springframework.stereotype.Service;

import com.example.demo.entity.Loan;

import com.example.demo.repository.LoanRepository;

@Service

public class LoanService {

    @Autowired

    private LoanRepository loanRepository;

    public List<Loan> getLoansByCustomerId(int customerId) {

        return loanRepository.findByCustomerId(customerId);

    }

}

In this code, we have created a LoanService that retrieves data from a MySQL database using a LoanRepository.

The @Autowired annotation is used to inject a LoanRepository object into the LoanService.

The getLoansByCustomerId method retrieves a list of loans by calling the findByCustomerId method of the LoanRepository with the customerId provided. The list of loans is then returned.

Here's the code for the LoanRepository:

java

Copy code

import java.util.List;

import org.springframework.data.jpa.repository.JpaRepository;

import com.example.demo.entity.Loan;

public interface LoanRepository extends JpaRepository<Loan, Integer> {

    List<Loan> findByCustomerId(int customerId);

}

In this code, we have created a LoanRepository that extends the JpaRepository interface. The findByCustomerId method is used to retrieve a list of loans by customerId.
